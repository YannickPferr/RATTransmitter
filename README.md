# RATTransmitter

Remote access tool transmitter implemented in java. [RAT Receiver](https://github.com/YannickPferr/RATReceiver) adddress needs to be changed in main method (should be moved to config or cmd line arg).
Runs silently in the background and enables receiver to:
- see the user's screen
- show a live view of the user's webcam(s)
- invert the user's mouse
- take a photo of the user's webcam

__Note: was only implemented for experimentation purposes__
